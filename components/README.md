# Components Directory

This directory contains reusable React components for the application.

## Structure

- `components/` - Root components directory
  - `ui/` - Reusable UI components (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.)
  - Other feature-specific components can be added here as needed

## Usage

Import components from this directory:

```tsx
import Button from '@/components/ui/Button';
```

The `@/` alias is configured in `tsconfig.json` to point to the project root.
